# VIO Temporal Offset

***This package is the source code of VIO Temporal Offset Optimization.***

In this paper, an initialization strategy is proposed with respect to monocular visual-inertial localization, which optimizes the temporal offset between a camera and an inertial measurement unit (IMU). Moreover, persistent refinement is involved in front-end processes, and specific states are optimized in back-end processes.

**The code frame is based on [**VINS-Mono**](https://github.com/HKUST-Aerial-Robotics/VINS-Mono).**
